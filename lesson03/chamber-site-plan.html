            <h2>WDD230 Chamber of Commerce Site Plan</h2>

            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>The name that was picked out for the website was “Rexburg Idaho Chamber of Commerce”
                The reason why is because the website would be based on a local community and wanted to have the purpose of the website to be clearly visible by just the title. Having a title like this is also short, clear and presentable, especially in a business sense, which is one of the main target audiences for this website as well.

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to help benefit the community, and this can be done by helping those looking to join the community as well as informing them about local events. Another way this would be helpful would be to bring to light the local businesses that are in Rexburg, which would also help the community as a whole financially as well.</p>
