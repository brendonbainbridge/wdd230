            <h2>WDD230 Chamber of Commerce Site Plan</h2>
            <p>This website will outline the plan for the Chamber of Commerce Site that is being put together as a class
                assignment. Below you will find the outlined details</p>

            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>The name that was picked out for the website was “Rexburg Idaho Chamber of Commerce”
                The reason why is because the website would be based on a local community and wanted to have the purpose
                of the website to be clearly visible by just the title. Having a title like this is also short, clear
                and presentable, especially in a business sense, which is one of the main target audiences for this
                website as well.

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to help benefit the community, and this can be done by helping those
                looking to join the community as well as informing them about local events. Another way this would be
                helpful would be to bring to light the local businesses that are in Rexburg, which would also help the
                community as a whole financially as well.</p>

                What is the contact information for the Rexburg Chamber of Commerce?<br><br>
                What is the benefit of becoming a part of the Chamber of Commerce as a business?<br><br>
                How can my business become a part of the Chamber of Commerce?<br><br>
                Where and what are good times to network and grow with the community?<br><br>

            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <p>The colors chosen for this website are due to the safety the community of Rexburg proudly has, as well as
                how the colors for BYUI are white and blue as well. Although the colors are the same as the school as a
                disclaimer. The website will most likely be based on two colors and going for a formal contrast look
                that was demonstrated later in the course. The two colors that will be used are “#E0E1DD” and “#0D1B2A”.
                “#0D1B2A” will be used for the background of the page, as well as the font withing white box’s (the
                other color). “#E0E1DD” will be used to be the color contrast to divide and organize things as. This
                style will be continuous throughout the body, header, sections, and footer as well.</p>

            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>The font that was chosen was due to the impression it wanted to leave for its target audiences. Which are both people in and joining the community, including college students, as well as local businesses. The font was a good mixture of both business professionalism, as well as a comfortable look for those not in the business world.</p>
